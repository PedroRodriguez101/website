        <h3 class="mbr-section-title display-2">CHAPTER I<br></h3>
        <div class="lead"><p>Our car spiraled through the railing guarding those on the road from the abyss beside it. Consumed by what felt a huge formless mass of eternal darkness, we spiral and plummeted deeper into the unseen. I could feel the whiplash shooting through my spine and the panic emitting from the orifices of everyone around me; echoing off the chaos. I could feel the car flip upside-down again, though this time my seat belt gave away. I'm flung down and into the ceiling of the car. I quickly grabbed hold the top of the seat under me, attempting to anchor myself of any further movement. I then hear a loud thump explode into my ears from outside. I'm forced downwards, my weight causing the seat to cock forward - crushing whomever was seated within. I quickly bring my arms to my head, bracing myself; only to be thrown upwards</p><p>My bones, muscles, joints and organs felt like they were being crumbled and smashed into a tiny box. My lungs contracted with such force that I was afraid they would fold into themselves. My torso and head smashed up against the ceiling while my arms and legs kept flailing, searching for something to hold onto. The world must have kept flickering its figurative light switch because my vision kept flashing from bitter darkness to a blinding yet distant white light - that of the streetlights far above. The only sound that filled my ears was the crushing of glass mixed with the distinct crackles of my bones and the sound of snapping branches.</p><p></p><div>But then it was all over in a very sudden and grand clash of metal against bare, jagged stone. Everything was still, and everything went dark. The car had flipped so many times that I had become disorientated before I even sustained the concussion that had me drifting in and out of consciousness. I felt fleetingly aware of the bloody taste in my own mouth and the sharp pains shooting throughout my body, yet I still couldn't figure out what it was. Everything happened so fast, like a blur, almost as if I couldn't believe it had. At times my eyelids fluttered and I thought I must've been at home in bed because it was so damn dark and the seat under me felt so soft compared to everything that had just happened.</div><div>'Why did I put us up to this?' I thought to myself, realizing where I was. I looked up to see a smashed side window; the moon trying to reach me, its pure light peering through the canopy atop. </div><div><br></div><div>Though, after all that, it was rather soothing. The quiet nature of the surrounding forest and the faint sounds of rain pelting against the metal of the car. Very soothing. <em>I'm crushed into this car and I can't really move. So, I mean I might as well just give in, right?</em> I sarcastically thought to myself. And sure enough, moments later; my consciousness ebbed and my mind went into a free fall - swirling with the beautiful chaos of the new dream that followed.</div><p></p></div>

        <div class="lead"><p>It was a cavern of no ends, the darkness stretching deep, far, and wide into the abyss. Tendrils of hope swallowed into the stifling black where space and time did not exist. The stars that attempted to light the way overhead smouldered in the darkness until nothing was left and even I was swallowed up in the infinite surrounding space. Suddenly, without any visible thing in sight or any audible cue, a paralyzing hurt spread through my body like icy, liquid metal. </p><p>The silence which pierced my ears surrendered to the horifying screams of crumbling stone. Sounds of something cracking and crushing itself into form echoed around me; all the while an ever-so faint white spec appeared in the distant abyss. The white streaks of light flowed across the ground and rock walls before me, seemingly leading me to its salvation. I clenched my fists as I hesitantly took each step. What choice did I have though? There was no where to go but straight up. My feet were trembling. My legs twitched, as if fighting the impulse to whirl around and sprint back down that damp, shadowed cavernous space. Fire in the form of water stung my eyes, threatening their attack as I continued to the growing light before me. I crunched my teeth over my lip harder than I ever had. Salty blood filled my mouth. </p><p>Slowly, my brain picked up my feet in an unbalanced gait, carelessly dropping the lead weights to the ground with each harrowing step. Reality tried to tap its way into my marching brain's rhythm. I need to wake up.</p><p></p></div>

        <h3 class="mbr-section-title display-2">CHAPTER III<br></h3>
        <div class="lead"><p>I rose to what seems like the following morning from a heavy slumber. I sit up, stretch and take in a deep breath. I then quickly realized that me sitting up, stretching and breating is worth getting excited for - judging by last night's events. I took in another breath, feeling the coolness of the air in my lungs and enjoying its loamy fragrance. The ground feels lumpy. Then <em>that</em> hit me too, I'm not in a toppled and destroyed car balcancing on some rocks. I'm outside, seemingly fine, on the bed of earth and twigs that I had seemingly spent the night on. My clothes fbeel rather damp. I half wonder if I'm still dreaming as I take in the shafts of light that burst through the gaps in the leaf canopy above. Though, now I'm awake, perhaps more fully awake than I've ever been in the last few days. There are no clear paths around me and no signs of any other person. I'm all by my lonesome in the middle of a forest; with the exception of the birds -  whom make their carefree song around me. But in that sweet melody, I feel all the more alone here.</p><p>Upon the forest floor lie trees of yesteryear, fallen in storms long forgotten. The seasons have been harsh, stripping away the bark and outer layers, yet rendering them all the more beautiful. They have the appearance of driftwood, twisting in patterns that remind me of seaside waves; even the colour of the moss is kelp-like. It's soft and wet to the touch, yet my fingers come away dry. I make my way through the forest taking everything in. The pines towered several stories over me, seemingly reaching toward the golden rays of spring above.</p><p>I push myself off the earth beneath me and stumble to my feet. 'Where is everyone?' I thought to myself, analyzing the area. In front of me was a decline into a clearing of sorts, followed by a distant trail shrouded in fog. I continue to scan the scene and see something shiny sticking out of a pile of stone. I slowly approach the metalic object and quickly realize what it was. It was a piece of the front bumper of our car. I slide my hand across it, wiping away the dirt. The dirt still feels damp, like it had been torn up recently? obviously that evening being last night. How'd I even get out here? I turn away and begin heading towards the clearing.</p><p>The clearing was encased in a mist. An unnatural, choking mist that swirled and sprawled on the forest floor. This already spoke of a strange sort of wrongness to me. The sickly white substance seemed to possess liquid properties, yet made no sound. It only ever parted to swallow up my feet as I marched upon the festering, uncharted forest floor. The sound of mushy and dead leaves whispered from under the skin of the mist. It was still daylight out however, the sky was also plainly visible now. The eerily faint sounds of the chirping birds and running water overtake the silence as I continue toward the trail.&nbsp;</p><p>Very clearly now, I hear it - the sound of splashing water. I pick up the pace a bit and trek deeper in the wooded dirt road. The canopy returns overhead, blocking out the sun almost completely. The ground of the trail beneath me transistions to water. Feeling the clumps of whatever vegetation floating about under the water, I continue on. The skin of the fog peels away slowly as I descend into a muddy swamp, probably peopled by hideous alligators wallowing in the green slime that is the bog water.</p><p></p></div>
